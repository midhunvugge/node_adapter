What is Refactoring?

Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior to help your future self or the next person that needs to maintain your code.

Refactoring can involve:

Deduplicating code.
Isolating logic by deconstructing code into intuitive functions offering a single place to review code.
Making code easier to read with good function, variable names and simple design patterns that don't require comments to infer the code's purpose. Comments certainly have value, but good design patterns don't need comments for someone to understand what the code does.
Refactoring Benefits:

Improves readability.
Reduces complexity.
Easier maintainance.
Easier debugging.
Reduces bugs.
